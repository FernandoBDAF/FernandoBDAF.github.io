    <h2>Working with the balls</h2>
    <p>I developed the following projects by myself without using AI or another sources of information, unless for questions about the languages I used.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>The first project was <a href="./1dmovingball.html">1d: Moving Ball</a> and I am not commenting much about it because was done in the course. I just create the following zizag function:</p>
            <img src="./1d&2dballexplained/1 zizag.png">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Next step I developed the project <a href="./1drandomspeeds.html">1d: Random Speeds</a>. First I did an upgrade, making possible create multiple balls, for this project I defineded 2 funcition: create and chooseBalls. In this particular functions, I defined velocities randomly which is the more fun effect of this project. The zigzag will be preatty much the same thing</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For the next project, <a href="./1dchangingcolor.html">1d: Changing Color</a> I started each ball with the same velocitie and I updated the zizag funtion to change color everytime the ball changed direction. Prior to that, I defined a function randomColor.</p>
            <img src="./1d&2dballexplained/3 changing color.png">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="./1dfinalchallenge.html">1d: Final Challenge</a>. My final 1d project was a combination of different effects. I had to work harder in the zizag function for achieve the final result. Have a look in the project and check the code:</p>
            <img src="./1d&2dballexplained/4 final 1d.png">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To start working with 2d movements - <a href="./2dmovingball.html">2d: Moving Ball</a> - I had to update the create functions. I improve the code for that comparing with the 1d projects, defining one single function for this job. Besides that, I had to defina space and speed for both cartesian X and Y.</p>
            <img src="./1d&2dballexplained/5 2d create function.png">
            <p>I also updated the zizag function for 2d and added an effect so the ball is changing color randomly while moving down.</p>
            <img src="./1d&2dballexplained/6 2d zizag changing colors.png">
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Finally I developd the <a href="./2dcollisiondetection.html">2d: Detecting Collisions</a> which aim to change the direction of 2 balls that collide. The final result is not perfect, there are a lot of edge cases to consider, but I it works well. For build this, I have to define a function checkCollisions.</p>

            <p>To have a more clear view, i start each ball in a random collor and removed all effects in the zizag function</p>
